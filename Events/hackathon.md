# Hackathon - 2021
---

> This hackathon was the first IT event I did and the first real competition I attend.<br>
> It was organized by the school and lasted all the weekend from friday to sunday.<br>
> The goal was to create an IT project in a team of 4 people across the years of study in 48 hours.<br>
> The theme was Sustainability development and had solve potential problems or upgrades for the school.<br>
> As it was the first time I did such an event and was in first year,<br> 
> I was a little lost with all the new technologies and tools to create our project.<br>
> We decided to create a web app that would bring carpooling within the school.<br>
> As my skills in development were not very good at the time,<br> 
> I found out that I was pretty good at thinking the functionalities and core concept of projects.<br>
> So at my surprise I became the project manager of the team and enjoyed explaining ideas.<br>
> I learned a lot of useful tips and tools on how to make a website and bring it online.<br>
> I discover that making good website is not easy and takes a lot of knowledge on the mater to make it good and secure.<br>
> It was also a great opportunity to make great bond with people and sharing interest.<br>
> We did not win the competition but we were proud of what we did in 48 hours.<br>
