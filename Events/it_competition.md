# IT Competition - 2022
---

> In 2022, I participated in the IT competition organized by the school.<br>
> The goal of the competition was to create an electronic project in a day.<br>
> This was my first introduction to electronic and microcontroller programming.<br>
> I was already really interested in little electronics and making little device for fun purpose like drones or self-made domotics.<br>
> So I was really excited to participate in this competition.<br>
> I was with a friend of mine, and we decided to make a Simon game where you had to remember a series of color in order<br>
> and repeat it with multiple buttons on a breadboard.<br>
> We had to use an Arduino board, some LED and buttons to make it work.<br>
> It was the most fun project I did in the school, and we were really proud of the result.<br>
> We succeeded to make it work, and **win the first place**!<br>
> Not only that, but we also won the "Funnier project" trophies <br>
> A funny things is that the trophies were NFT made by the school and so I also got my first NFT that time!<br>
> I learned a lot from my friends who were already better in electronics than me, and discover my passions for little electronics project like that.<br>
> Now I try to tackle more complex projects like making robot and tracking device.<br>
