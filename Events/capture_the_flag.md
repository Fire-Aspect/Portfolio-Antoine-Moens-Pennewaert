# Capture the flag - 2022
---

> In 2022, I participated in the Capture the Flag event organized by some third year students for their final year project.<br>
> This event took place in the school's computer lab and lasted for 15 hours and 30 minutes.<br>
> The goal was to solve a series of challenges in the different fields learned in the course.<br>
> It could be cryptography, web security, reverse engineering, .ect <br>
> And when we solved it we got a flag that we had to submit to the platform to get points.<br>
> This was the first time I participated in such an event and I enjoyed it a lot.<br>
> I was in my first year and the competition was open to all years, so it was not easy at all!<br>
> But we were a team of 4 with people in all years of study, so I could learn and see what I was going to see in the course.<br>
> I learned a lot of tools, website and techniques that I would use for later classes.<br>
> It is also at this event that I make great bond with some of my best friends today.<br>
> In the end we did not win but we were not last either.<br>
> After the different events I did in the three years of my courses, I can say that the CTF is my favorite type of event.<br>
